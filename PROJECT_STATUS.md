# Fabric Data Analytics - Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-07
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress - Data Quality Phase

---

## Project Overview

Building an end-to-end Accounts Payable analytics solution using Microsoft Fabric and Power BI, demonstrating skills in:
- Data ingestion (Dataflow Gen2)
- Data transformation (SQL in Lakehouse)
- Semantic modeling (Power BI)
- DAX measure development
- Report design and visualization

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Created Dataflow Gen2 in Microsoft Fabric
   - Loaded 3 SAP tables to Lakehouse:
     - `BSEG` (Line Items) - 270 records
     - `BKPF` (Document Headers) - 142 records
     - `LFA1` (Vendor Master) - 50 records
   - Date range: Jan-Dec 2024
   - Location: `SapDataLakehouse`

2. **SQL Transformation Layer**
   - Created two-stage transformation:
     - **Stage 1**: `accounts_payable_staging` - Data type casting with flexible date/amount parsing
     - **Stage 2**: `accounts_payable_fact` - Business logic and calculated fields
   - Features:
     - Proper date handling (YYYYMMDD → DATE)
     - Decimal casting for amounts
     - NULL/empty string handling
     - Vendor master data enrichment
     - Document type classification (Invoice, Payment, Credit Memo)
     - Due date calculations
     - Data quality flags
   - Supporting views:
     - `ap_data_quality_summary`
     - `ap_vendor_summary`
   - File: `/sql/create_ap_fact_table.sql`

3. **DAX Measures Development**
   - **Core AP Measures** (40+ measures):
     - Base metrics (invoice amounts, payments, vendor counts)
     - Aging analysis (DPO, overdue buckets)
     - Payment performance (on-time rate, average days)
     - Cash discount tracking (utilization, potential savings)
     - Time intelligence (YTD, QTD, MTD, YoY growth)
     - Vendor analytics (rankings, concentration)
     - Data quality metrics
   - File: `/dax/ap_measures.dax`

   - **Data Quality Measures**:
     - Field completeness percentages
     - Missing data counts
     - Quality score (0-100%)
     - Coverage metrics
     - Issue identification
   - File: `/dax/data_quality_measures.dax`

4. **Power BI Report Design Documentation**
   - 6-page report structure designed:
     - Page 0: Data Quality Overview (NEW - currently building)
     - Page 1: Executive Dashboard
     - Page 2: Aging & Overdue Analysis
     - Page 3: Payment Performance
     - Page 4: Vendor Analysis
     - Page 5: Cash Discount Optimization
     - Page 6: Drill-Through Detail
   - Complete specifications for each page (visuals, fields, slicers)
   - Files:
     - `/docs/powerbi_report_design.md`
     - `/docs/data_quality_page_design.md`

5. **Power BI Semantic Model**
   - Published `accounts_payable_fact` table from Lakehouse
   - Imported all DAX measures (except `Active Vendors (Current Month)` - had STARTOFMONTH error)
   - Data types validated (dates as DATE, amounts as DECIMAL)

### 🟡 In Progress

1. **Data Quality Overview Page (Page 0)**
   - Purpose: Pre-flight check before analysis
   - Currently building first visuals:
     - Quality score card
     - Issue counts table
     - Field completeness matrix
   - Next: Complete remaining 11 visuals per design spec

### 🔴 Known Issues

1. **Data Type Challenges (RESOLVED)**
   - ✅ Fixed: All dates now parse correctly (YYYYMMDD format)
   - ✅ Fixed: Empty strings converted to NULL
   - ✅ Fixed: Currency amounts cast to DECIMAL(15,2)

2. **Single-Year Dataset Limitation**
   - All data is from 2024 only
   - YoY measures return BLANK (no 2023 data)
   - Workaround: Use MoM or QoQ comparisons instead
   - Alternative: Generate 2023 sample data if YoY demo needed

3. **DAX Measure Error**
   - `Active Vendors (Current Month)` measure fails
   - Issue: `STARTOFMONTH(TODAY())` requires binary result
   - Status: Excluded from model for now
   - Fix: Replace with proper date column reference

### ⏸️ Not Started

1. **Power BI Report Development**
   - Pages 1-6 design complete, implementation pending
   - Visuals to build: ~50+ across 6 pages
   - Estimated time: 4-6 hours

2. **Testing & Validation**
   - Cross-check measures with SQL aggregations
   - Validate aging buckets logic
   - Test drill-through functionality

3. **Documentation**
   - User guide for report navigation
   - Data refresh schedule setup
   - Measure definitions reference

## Data Quality Summary

Based on current dataset (as of last SQL run):

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total Line Items | 426 | ✅ |
| Total Documents | 142 | ✅ |
| Unique Vendors | 50 | ✅ |
| Date Range | Jan-Dec 2024 | ⚠️ Single year |
| Posting Date Completeness | 100% | ✅ |
| Vendor Number Completeness | ~67% | ⚠️ GL lines have no vendor |
| Vendor Master Match | 100% | ✅ |
| Payment Terms Completeness | ~33% | ⚠️ Expected for GL lines |

**Overall Assessment:** Data quality is good for vendor line items (account_type = 'K'). GL account lines (account_type = 'S') expectedly have no vendor or payment terms.

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Two-Stage SQL Transformation**
   - Rationale: Separates data quality from business logic
   - Benefit: Easier debugging, reusable for different data formats
   - Trade-off: Creates intermediate staging table

2. **All Business Logic in SQL (Not DAX)**
   - Rationale: Better performance, reusable across tools
   - Applied to: signed_amount, vendor_liability_amount, document_type_description
   - Exception: Time intelligence stays in DAX (native support)

3. **Keep Both document_type and document_type_description**
   - `document_type`: Raw SAP code (RE, KZ) for filtering in views
   - `document_type_description`: Human-readable (Invoice, Payment) for Power BI

4. **Flexible Date Parsing**
   - Uses SUBSTRING + CONCAT to convert YYYYMMDD → YYYY-MM-DD
   - Then TRY_CAST to DATE
   - Handles both 8-digit and ISO formats

5. **Data Quality Page as Page 0**
   - Shows quality issues upfront
   - Allows stakeholders to understand limitations
   - Builds trust in reporting

## Dependencies

- Microsoft Fabric workspace: (workspace name TBD)
- Lakehouse: `SapDataLakehouse`
- Semantic model: Connected to `accounts_payable_fact` table
- Power BI Desktop version: (version TBD)

---

## Questions for Next Session

1. Should we generate 2023 data to enable YoY measures?
2. What priority for remaining pages (1-6)?
3. Any specific KPIs or thresholds to highlight?
4. Target audience: Finance team, Management, or both?
5. Refresh frequency requirement: Daily, Weekly, Monthly?

---

## Notes

- All SQL includes `%%sql` header for direct paste into Fabric notebooks
- Sample data is realistic German vendor data (Siemens, BASF, VW, etc.)
- All amounts in EUR
- Payment terms standard: 30 days with 2% cash discount
- Document types: RE (Invoice), KZ (Payment), KG (Credit Memo - not in sample)
